# Textbook Synthesizer

Textbook Synthesizer is a tool designed to help educators efficiently convert textbook content into structured lesson plans. It extracts key points, objectives, and summaries from the text, saving time and ensuring consistency in lesson planning.

## Overview

### Project Name
**Textbook Synthesizer**

### Description
Textbook Synthesizer analyzes textbook content to generate structured lesson plans. It automates the extraction of key points, objectives, and summaries, providing educators with a consistent and quick way to prepare their lessons.

### Problem
Teachers and educators often spend a significant amount of time synthesizing textbook content into lesson plans, which can be inefficient and inconsistent.

### Target Audience
Educators, teachers, and instructional designers who need to create lesson plans from textbook content quickly and consistently.

### Reusability
The custom action for synthesizing content can be adapted for:
- Other types of educational content: Synthesizing articles, research papers, or educational videos into lesson plans.
- Curriculum design: Creating outlines for courses or training programs from various sources.

### Motivation
Automating the process of creating lesson plans can save time for educators, allowing them to focus on teaching and interacting with students, and ensure that lesson plans are consistent and aligned with educational objectives.
